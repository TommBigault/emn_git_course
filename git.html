## About VC
]
.right-column[
Version Control is the management of changes to documents.

- The need to organize and control revisions is probably as old as writing.

- Became more prominent with the advent of printing.

- And even more in our computer age.

Version Control Systems offer a mean to:

- Keep every version of a document.

- Revert files back to a previous state.
- Revert the entire project back to a previous state.

- Compare changes over time.

- Find what changes from when are causing a problem.

- and more&#133;

People used to copy or archive files in time-stamped directories:

- Very common because so simple.
- But also error prone when the number of versions increases &#9760;.

__Answer__: a Version Control Systems implementation local to a computer.

- A database keep all the changes done to a file.
- Changes are kept sequentially (delta patches.)
- It is possible to re-create any version of any file.

__Example__: RCS

_But what when multiple developers need to collaborate?_

__Answer:__ Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS).

1. A single server that contains all the versioned files.

2. A number of clients that _check out_ files.

__Cons:__ the server is the single point of failure!

- Server down &#8658; no _check out_ no _commit_ &#128544;.

- Can be compromised and rogue data inserted &#128561;.

- Hardware crash can mean the loss of a whole project &#128565;.

- etc &#128531;.

_Is there anything better than CVCS, with more than one server?_

__Answer:__ Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS).

Not one server anymore but instead all clients are servers:

- All clients mirror the _repository_ with the complete history.

- Solves all single point of failure problems but means more organization:
  - clients can be dealing with several _repositories_ instead of a single one.
  - new workflows, possibly feeling more complex for users used to CVCS.

***

__Examples:__ Mercurial, Bazaar, Darcs, Git.
]
???
This is where Distributed Version Control Systems step in

If any server dies and these systems were collaborating via it any of the client repo can be copied back up to the server and restore it.

Every checkout is a full backup of all the data.

## Terminology
]
.right-column[
A few terms used when talking about Version Control Systems:

- __repository__: where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a
server.

- __working copy__: the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time
or revision.

- __check out__: create a local working copy from the repository.

- __change__, __change set__: a specific modification to one or multiple documents
under version control.

- __commit__: to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the
repository.

- __branch__: in branches different versions of the files can evolve
independently.

- __head__: the most recent commit of a branch.
]
???
Comments:

- check out: A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The
term 'checkout' can also be used as a noun to describe the working copy.

- working copy: All work done to the files in a repository is
initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a sandbox.

- change, changeset: The granularity of the modification considered a change
varies between version control systems.
    On many version control systems with atomic multi-change commits, a change
list, change set, update, or patch identifies the set of changes made in a
single commit. This can also represent a sequential view of the source code,
allowing the examination of source "as of" any particular changelist ID.

- commit: To commit (check in, ci or, more rarely, install, submit or record) is
to The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new
revision that is created as a result of committing.

- branch: A set of files under version control may be branched or forked at a
point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may
develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.

- head: Also sometimes called tip, this refers to the most recent commit, either
to the trunk or to a branch. The trunk and each branch have their own head,
though HEAD is sometimes loosely used to refer to the trunk.[7]

## Terminology
]
.right-column[
A few terms used when talking about Version Control Systems:

- __master__, __trunk__, __mainline__: the unique line of development that is
not a branch.

- __label__, __tag__, __baseline__: refers to an important snapshot in time (for
instance a release version.)

- __merge__: operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set
of files.

- __conflict__: occurs when different parties make changes to the same document,
and the system is unable to reconcile the changes.

- __resolve__: user intervention to address a conflict.
]
???
Comments:

- label: These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly,
meaningful name or revision number. See baselines, labels and tags.

- merge: A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are
applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows:
  - A user, working on a set of files, updates or syncs their working copy with
changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users.[8]
  - A user tries to check in files that have been updated by others since the
files were checked out, and the revision control software automatically merges
the files
  - A branch is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the
updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified trunk.

- conflict: A user must resolve the conflict by combining the changes, or by
selecting one change in favour of the other.

- resolve:     The act of user intervention to address a conflict between
different changes to the same document.

## History
]
.right-column[
Originates from Linux kernel development:

- From 1991-2002 changes to the kernel were passed around as patches and
archived files.

- In 2002, the Linux kernel project started using a proprietary DVCS called
BitKeeper.

- In 2005, relationship between the Linux kernel community and the company
developing BitKeeper broke down.

&#8658; Linus Torvalds started to develop its own tool based on the lessons he
learned managing the Linux kernel project and while using BitKeeper.

The new system goals were:

- Speed.
- Simple design.
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of branches.)
- Fully distributed.
- Ability to handle large projects efficiently.

Comments:

free-of-charge status was revoked.

Of course Linux kernel is a large project.

## Nearly every operation is local.

Once you _check out_ a project repository, all the data of the
project is mirrored locally. Hence:

- Browsing the history is done locally.

- Analyzing the history is done locally.

- You can work even if you don't have a network access.

&#8658; Git looks fast because everything is local. Of course at the expense of
more disk storage.

Work offline: edit files and commit changes locally: not possible with CVS or
Subversion.

## Git has integrity

- Everything in Git is check-summed before being stored.

- If something (file, directory) changed, Git knows about it.

- Uses SHA-1 hash for check-sum:
  - 40-character string of hexadecimal characters.
  - Calculated based on the contents of a file or directory.
  - Looks like this:

  `d8019750d4a0e791bb8fc985576a12f32ef59ac8`

- SHA-1 hashes are used all over the place in Git.

## Git generally only adds data

- Nearly all actions on git are only adding data.

- It is difficult to do anything that is undoable.

- Once changes are committed you can (almost) not lose them.

- Even more difficult if you pushed your changes to a remote repository.

## Files have three states.

![Files have three states](images/file_three_states.png)
]
???

- _Modified_ means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your
database yet.

- _Committed_ means that the data is safely stored in your local database. 

- _Staged_ means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to
go into your next commit snapshot.

- The _Git directory_ is where Git stores the metadata and object database for
your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied
when you clone a repository from another computer.

- The _working directory_ is a single checkout of one version of the project.
These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and
placed on disk for you to use or modify.

- The _staging area_ is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory,
that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes
referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the
staging area.

Branches is one of Git many great feature.

- Branches cab be merged together.

Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration
variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These
variables can be stored in three different places:

 - /etc/gitconfig file: Contains values for every user on the system and all
their repositories. If you pass the option--system to git config, it reads and
writes from this file specifically.
 - ~/.gitconfig file: Specific to your user. You can make Git read and write to
this file specifically by passing the --global option.
 - config file in the git directory (that is, .git/config) of whatever
repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository. Each
level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump
those in /etc/gitconfig.

### Use Git and github

Using the repository located at http://github.com/tytouf/emn_git_exo,
you are asked to:

1. In a branch, one commit per action:
    1. Create an empty file.
    1. Modify this file, add and remove lines.
    1. Rename this file, change its name or directory.
    1. Delete the file.
1. Create a branch, write test and update code to convert 50 to "L". Push branch.
1. Checkout commit 22314d2 as a new branch, capitalize roman numbers and rebase this new branch onto master.
1. Checkout commit 22314d2 as a new branch, capitalize roman numbers and merge this new branch into master.
1. Take some time to think how these two ways to manage changes can work in a real situation.
1. Do an interactive rebase where you squash two commits (fc1f408 and 0b65a6d)
1. Do an interactive rebase where you will split commit 5886a61 into two commits.
